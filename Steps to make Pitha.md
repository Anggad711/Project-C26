One can also mix Egg to improve taste. 
After the mixing is done, apply some refined oil on a frying pan, and like one should so, spread the oil properly over the pan.
Then, heat the pan at high temperature for 3-4 mins, after which, with a serving spoon, take the mixture of rice powder and milk and pour it over the pan, making a circular shape like a roti.
